      <h2>About the box</h2>
        <p>The Blind Date Box sparked as an idea when a group of my friends didn't have a date for BYU-I Date Night.
            We wanted to create a fun and exciting way for people to go on dates and meet new people.
            The box allows individuals to submit their names and interests, which are then randomly paired with others who have done the same.
        </p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to break the societal norms of dating based on looks and social media profiles.
            We believe that true connections are made through shared experiences and genuine interactions.
            By removing the emphasis on physical appearance, we aim to foster deeper connections and meaningful relationships.
